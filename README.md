# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game developed in Java that has both a one and two player mode.
Two player mode is between two humans. 
One player mode is between a human and the computer which will have 3 modes (easy, medium and HARD). 

This project is still being developed and has a lot to be improved. I shall try to update this as much as possible while in Uni. 

Current aims for this project: 
  - Implement a menu. DONE
  - Allow players to pick the square they would like to place their X or O in. DONE
  - Stop the game when all squares are taken. DONE
  - Check for inproper values and make player reinput if there is an error. DONE
  - Continually check the board to see if someone has won yet. IN PROGRESS
  - End the game once someone has won and tell the player(s) who won. IN PROGRESS

  - Develop an AI that will play a human player.
  - Give the AI 3 modes - easy, medium and HARD.
  - Add heckling from the computer??

  - Add UI that is interactable so that you do not have to use the text based terminal.
